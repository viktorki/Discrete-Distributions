<h1>Discrete-Distributions</h1>
This is a web application that can help you understand the basic concepts of random processes.
<h2>Main Functionalities</h2>
<ul>
The application has two main functionalities:
<li>The first one gives you the ability to work with discrete random variables. You can find their numerical characteristics (like expectation, variance, etc.). Also, you can work with two variables and examine their mutual dependance.</li>
<li>The second one gives you information about the most common discrete distributions (like binomial distribution, hypergeometric distribution, etc.). You can solve simple problems using these discrete distributions. You get not only the theoretical results but also the results obtained by runtime random generation. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals for the second milestone</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementing classes for working with random variables.</li>
<li>Implementing classes for working with discrete distributions.</li>
</ul>
